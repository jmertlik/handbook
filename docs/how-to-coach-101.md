# How to Coach 101

We want the coaching sessions to be as personal and natural as possible. No strict guidelines here, just some loose recommendations!

## Your first student
1. You and the student have access to their GDrive folder, containing their training outline and discovery meeting notes
2. Review and understand their background and their training outline
3. Schedule your weekly 1-hour online meetings with the student
4. Make sure the student [is prepped](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FKjID9-_C0PSYRwZO2FQRb6FlFrDxozJ8hEFN4evs3A)
5. Schedule a 30-minute call with Sahand before your very first session

## The student should always be working on a project
For example, to learn HTML/CSS/JS, they will be building a simple web app. The student selects the project; you control the scope and guide them. You can use the project as the curriculum. Start from the simple things (h1, div, etc.) to more complex parts (javascript). 

Check out the #projects channel in slack to see some examples of what other students are doing.

## Your first session probably looks like this:
- Intro
- Talk about their project
- Introduce/teach new concepts (VSCode, Github, html, ...)
- Practice new concepts in the project code
- Give them some detailed tasks
- Send them some resources (references, youtube, udemy, ...)

## The student should be committing/pushing consistently
Ideally, from day one and then every day for the rest of the program. Even if it’s a 1 line change, this helps them build an [active GitHub account](https://github.com/adam-paul952/) and get comfortable with coding.

## Do what YouTube can't do
- Explaining new complex concepts in a way that relates to them
- Setting up their local dev machine, so they’re not stuck configuring stuff
- Code review, best practices, discussing different approaches
- Providing them with good resources (youtube, docs, articles, books, etc.)
- Telling an exciting story/fact about a technology

## Treat the student as a junior developer
Imagine they are a junior developer who just joined your company and you are their mentor/supervisor. This means:
- Guide them, but don’t solve their problems
- Teach them to use Google, docs, … before asking for help
- They should have ownership and decision-making over their project
- Try to connect with them. Talk about their/your hobbies, everyday, goals.

## Other stuff
- Please message Jan and send him a pro picture, your title, company and technologies you are an expert in. It’s going on our website [like this](https://www.get-coding.ca/our-instructors).

- To get paid follow these steps:
    - Request access on [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1mTaio_uGfzEPeS7Hj3imUL7gbGAvZNoqvlbwEJj5tI4/edit#gid=0).
    - Record the date of each session with your student after each session so you don’t forget. 
    - You will get paid at the end of each month. 

- Feel free to use the Slack channel to chat with any of the other students or coaches, promote events, share resources or jobs, etc.
